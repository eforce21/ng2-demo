# Angular2 Demo

This project aims to demonstrate the use of different ways to handle common use cases in an Angular2 app. It uses the [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/)
as a build tool. To start the app run the command `ng serve` on the level of the `angular-cli.json` file. Please refer to the
 [installation guide](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) to learn how to install the angular-cli. This demo app also uses the PrimeNG component library by [PrimeTek](http://www.primetek.com.tr/). Please refer to their [user guide](http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/)
 for more information.
 
 **Disclaimer**  
 The code is not production ready. It is kept as simple as possible for the sake of the example. Please feel free to use
  the examples and fit them to your needs but I will not feel responsible for any damage done to your app due by blindly 
  copying any examples and using them in your application without reflecting the impact or adding necessary security.
