# Angular2 Demo

This project aims to demonstrate the use of different ways to handle common use cases in an Angular2 app. It uses the [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/)
as a build tool. To start the app run the command `ng serve` on the level of the `angular-cli.json` file. Please refer to the
 [installation guide](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) to learn how to install the angular-cli. This demo app also uses the PrimeNG component library by [PrimeTek](http://www.primetek.com.tr/). Please refer to their [user guide](http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/)
 for more information.
